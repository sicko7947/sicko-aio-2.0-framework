# SickoAIO Bot Framework (v2.0)

Hi, I‚Äôm **Sicko** ‚Äî many of you might know me from **SickoAIO**, a sneaker/AIO bot I launched back in **2021**. After a successful release of version 1.0, the scene started shifting fast. With constant CDN security updates and personal life catching up, I burned out. Over time, the passion faded, and I couldn‚Äôt keep up with the arms race anymore.

But after 4 years, I‚Äôve decided to **open source the entire SickoAIO 2.0 framework**, fully rewritten in **Golang**. This is a **high-concurrency**, **scalable** system that may be useful when building performance-critical frameworks ‚Äî whether for botting, automation, or other use cases.

## üß± Architecture Overview

The framework is modular and split into a few key components:

- [`auth-grpc`](https://github.com/sicko7947/sicko-aio-2.0-auth) ‚Äì authentication and license verification layer  
- [`server-grpc`](https://github.com/sicko7947/sicko-aio-2.0-server) ‚Äì core orchestration and for getting cookies or bypassing security measures
- [`client-backend`](https://github.com/sicko7947/sicko-aio-2.0-client) ‚Äì backend logic for task handling and data flow  
- [`client-frontend`](https://github.com/sicko7947/sicko-aio-2.0-frontend-vue)‚Äì UI panel for task management and control  

Each part is designed to be highly concurrent and distributed-friendly.

## üß† Dev Notes & Insights

Over the years I‚Äôve explored a lot of deep technical areas ‚Äî from:

- CDN edge caching tricks
- Reverse engineering flows
- Custom TLS fingerprinting
- Many more...

I plan to **slowly release more repos, writeups, or code samples** on these areas over time.

> ‚ùó **Important Note:** I will **not** be open sourcing the specific logic I used to tackle Akamai's cookie protection ‚Äî even if it's outdated ‚Äî due to **legal and ethical reasons**.
